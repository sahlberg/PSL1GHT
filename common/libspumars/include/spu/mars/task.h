 * You can wait for task completion by calling \ref mars_task_wait or

 * execution has completed. The task id is valid until the task is destroyed by
 * \ref mars_task_destroy.
 *
 * <b>Key Parameters</b>:
 * \n \n
 * \e args
 * - The task args (\ref mars_task_args) are optional, and only
 * need to be passed in if the task executable expects it.
 * - If NULL is specified the task args passed into the task executable's main
 * function will not be initialized.
 * - The args does need to be kept allocated after this function returns.
 *
 * \e priority
 * - This is the priority of the task between 0 to 255, 0 being the lowest
 * priority and 255 being the highest priority.
 * - Tasks with higher priority will be prioritized during scheduling if both
 * tasks are ready to run at the time of scheduling.

 * \brief <b>[host/MPU]</b> Unschedules a MARS task from being executed.
 *
 * This function unschedules a previously scheduled task.
 *
 * When a task is unscheduled, it will behave as if the task has completed
 * execution. The user is responsible for specifying a unique exit code when
 * unscheduling tasks to handle the condition accordingly.
 *
 * If a scheduled task is unscheduled before execution, the workload will
 * not be executed until a subsequent scheduling request is made.
 *
 * If the task is currently in a waiting state, calling unschedule will
 * finish the workload and will not be resumed from the waiting state.
 *
 * If the task is currently in a running state, calling unschedule will
 * immediately put the task into a finished state. However, execution of the
 * task will only be suspended when the task yields, waits, or exits.
 *
 * \note
 * Trying to unschedule a task that has not yet been scheduled, or has
 * already finished a previously scheduled execution will return an error.
 *
 * <b>Key Parameters</b>:
 * \n \n
