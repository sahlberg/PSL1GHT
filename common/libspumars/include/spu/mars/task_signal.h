 * This function sends a signal to the task specified. If the task had
 * previously called \ref mars_task_signal_wait and was in the waiting state,
 * this function will cause that task to switch to a ready state and scheduled
 * to run accordingly. If the task has not yet called
 * \ref mars_task_signal_wait, the tasks's signal buffer will be set and the
 * same order of events will occur as previously explained once
 * \ref mars_task_signal_wait is called. The task signal buffer depth is 1.
 * Therefore if the signal buffer is already set when a another signal is
 * received, it has no effect.
